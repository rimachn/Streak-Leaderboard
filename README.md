# Streak Leaderboard — User Engagement Analysis

**Project Type:** Data Analysis & Time-Series Logic

## Objective
You work for a popular language learning company and have a table containing ~900,000 lesson completions, including the date, user, and lesson ID.

Your task is to calculate the active streak for each user, then create a leaderboard of the top 10 users with the longest active streaks.

The streak length is the number of consecutive days with at least one lesson completion

For the purpose of this drill, consider the current date to be 2025-09-29

For a streak to be considered “active”, the user must have completed a lesson on 2025-09-28

## Tools Used
- SQL

## Notes
This project demonstrates how raw event-level activity logs can be transformed into engagement metrics using time-based logic. Streak calculations like this are widely used in learning platforms, fitness apps, and habit-tracking products.
